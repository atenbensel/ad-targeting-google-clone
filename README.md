# Ad Keyword Targeting/Ranking
I'm creating a simple set of scripts to target ads like google does. This one is for Elon.
<nr>
Here's the equation for the score of the tweet: <br>
score = K * m + V + P
<br>
K is the number of keywords in the tweet
m is the multiplicative factor for using all the keywords, i.e., m = 1 if all keywords are present, otherwise m = 0
V is the verification bonus, i.e., V = 1 if the tweet author is verified, otherwise V = 0
P is the promotion bonus, i.e., P = 2 if the tweet is promoted, otherwise P = 0
<br>
<br>
Once the score has a weighted calculation, using user defined keywords, the weighted variable should show, in order from highest score to lowest score, the tweets that feature those keywords as it pertains to the weighted system.
<br>
Honestly, this would be better as a SIMLA but this is just an idea.
