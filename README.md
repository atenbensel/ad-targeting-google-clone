# Ad Keyword Targeting/Ranking
I'm creating a simple set of scripts to target ads like google does. This one is for Elon.

Here's the equation for the score of the tweet:
score = K * m + V + P

K is the number of keywords in the tweet
m is the multiplicative factor for using all the keywords, i.e., m = 1 if all keywords are present, otherwise m = 0
V is the verification bonus, i.e., V = 1 if the tweet author is verified, otherwise V = 0
P is the promotion bonus, i.e., P = 2 if the tweet is promoted, otherwise P = 0
